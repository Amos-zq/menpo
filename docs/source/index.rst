Welcome to Menpo's documentation.

If you are new to Menpo, we strongly recommend you check out the User Guide,
which provides a broad overview of the project. After that you may wish to
explore the notebooks, which give detailed examples for all aspects of Menpo
that you can execute.

Finally, Menpo's source is extensively documented. If you have a question about
the behaviour of a particular class or function you should head to the the
Menpo API.
